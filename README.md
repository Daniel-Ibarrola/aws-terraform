# AWS Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

This repository is dedicated to practicing infrastructure provisioning in AWS using Terraform. It serves as a learning platform for setting up and managing cloud resources in a structured and reusable manner. Its purpose is to enable developers and cloud engineers to familiarize themselves with Terraform and AWS services while building practical infrastructure setups.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to explore how to provision AWS resources using Terraform. This includes creating examples to provision various types of infrastructure, from containerized applications to databases, networking, and more.

The repository will gradually expand as new infrastructure examples are added.

## Available Infrastructure Setups

Below are the infrastructures currently configured in this repository:

1. **ECS Web Application**  
   Provision a containerized web application with a React frontend and an Express backend on AWS ECS with Fargate.  
   [Learn more](infrastructure/ecs-app/README.md)

As additional examples are developed, they will be linked here.

## Contribution and Expansion

This repository is open for expansion with more examples of AWS infrastructure setups. Contributions are welcome to add variety and complexity to the examples provided. Each infrastructure example will reside in a dedicated folder with comprehensive documentation.

As the repository grows, it is recommended to follow the README file for each infrastructure example for specific instructions and details.

Feel free to practice and experiment with the configurations to deepen your understanding of Terraform and AWS operations!
